## Project Objective
Investigate retention for player's of a mobile app by using a relational database and writing queries to aggregate data for the purposes of reporting and visualization.

## Points of investigation
-Retention rate (30-day rolling)
-Age of players
-Location of players
-Individual spend within app

## Tables Created
-Retention Rate by Day of the Year *(Appendix 1 in queries)*
-Retention Status by Member *(Appendix 2 in queries)*

## Business Questions & Exploratory Analysis
### 1. What percentage of the game's players showed retention by continuing to play the game more than 30 days after they day they joined?
Of the 40,452 players who joined the game over the span of the year, 27,687 of those players were considered retained (68.44%). *(Appendix 3 in queries)*

### 2. What is the fractional retention throughout the year and does this vary at specific times of the year?
By investigating the fractional retention for each of the days of the year, we can see a *very slight* downward trend toward the end of the year. In general,

4. How does retention vary by region?
5. What are the most significant age groupings of the players of this game?
6. What regions are the players based in and how many players are in each of these regions?
7. What is the total spend within the app by the players in each of the regions?
8. What is the most profitable age segmentation playing this game?
